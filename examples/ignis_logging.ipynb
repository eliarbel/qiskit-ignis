    "Ignis logging is based on [Python's logging package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html). There are 3 classes in the Ignis logging package: \n",

    "* **IgnisLogger** - Objects of this class are used for logging. The class is derived from the Logger class defined in the Python's logging package\n",
    "* **IgnisLogging** - A singleton class responsible for configuring logging behavior in Ignis as well as for creating and getting IgnisLogger objects.\n",
    "* **IgnisLogReader** - A class for reading file logs created by IgnisLogger objects. Support basic filtering capabilities. \n",
